### No Upgrade Path from version 3.x

Due to the significant structure change in AppStrap 4.x there is no upgrade path from previous versions. The large number of changes and complete Gulp workflow rebuilt made it near impossible to provide an upgrade path, the good news is that is you use the new create-project command to create new projects future upgrades will be easier and smoother.
