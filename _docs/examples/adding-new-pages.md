All pages within the theme are designed to be copy & pasted to help you quickly get started with page building.

When you use the <a href="/get-started/1-project-setup/">create-project command</a> all .html files from the parent /src directory are automatically copied to your projects /src/html directory. From there you can delete, copy or edit any of the files independently from the parent theme or any other projects. 

> In a future release we'll be expanding the `create-project` command to allow you to copy specific files into your existing or new projects.
