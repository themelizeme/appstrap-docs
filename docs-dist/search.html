Example - Add the following to your &lt;head&gt; tags below the &lt;!--Your custom colour override--&gt; &lt;link href=\"css colour-blue.css\" id=\"colour-scheme\" rel=\"stylesheet\" &gt; NOTE: You will need to do this on all pages to implement site wide. The “colour-scheme” ID tag is only required if you want the jQuery colour switcher to be functionality. Quickest way to hide the colour switcher is to add .colour-switcher { display: none; } to your CSS. If you are comfortable with using Sass it’s recommended to override the colour scheme by altering the $primary_colour variables and then recompiling the CSS, see the assets scss example-custom-colour.scss file for an example."

						"content": "Since AppStrap version 3.0.5 Sass files (.scss) for compile the CSS code have been included to allow quick customisation of the core AppStrap CSS files. If you’re new to Sass we recommend taking a course over at uDemy like: https: www.udemy.com sasscourse a) Compiling using Gulp: Gulp is a task runner which we recommend you use gulp to compile the sass files into css. Included in AppStrap’s theme directory are 2 files which gulp uses: package.json - this defines the gulp dependencies AppStrap needs to compile the sass files gulpfile.js - this defines the gulp tasks which should run to compile the sass files into css code, there are also some “clean up” tasks run on Javascript &amp; images. Installing Gulp: Step 1) Gulp needs node.js &amp; node package manager (npm) to run so those need to be installed first, instructions are here: https: docs.npmjs.com getting-started installing-node Step 2) Open up terminal or command line and type the following command to install gulp globally on your machine: npm install --global gulp-cli Type gulp -v to ensure gulp installed correctly, if it did you’ll see something like: [13:42:05] CLI version 3.9.1 [13:42:05] Local version 3.9.1 Step 3) Type the following command to install all the gulp dependencies defined by the package.json file: npm install --save-dev gulp If everything work correctly you should see a new directory called node_modules which is full of the dependencies gulp needs to function. Once you’ve finished your development you can remove this directory and just run the above command again to get the latest dependencies each time. Step 4) Type the following command to have gulp watch for file changes to the .scss &amp; .js files: gulp watch Alternative you can just type gulp to compile .scss &amp; .js files and compress all images in the theme on a one off basis. You can use “Ctrl” + “c” to exit gulp at anytime. You can look for any errors in terminal after running the above commands. To find out more about gulp see: http: gulpjs.com . b) Compiling using an app GUI If you don’t want to mess around with gulp or node.js there are a number of apps out there which can compile sass code into css. We recommend the following apps: http: koala-app.com https: codekitapp.com index.html http: livereload.com https: mhs.github.io scout-app Example sass files There are a number of example .scss files prefixed with “example-*.scss” to show you how you can change things within the theme or strip back to only the styles you want. We have broken up the sass files into logical includes to make it easier for you to pick and choose which styles to include. If you would like a specific example please email us at info@themelize.me and we’ll do our best to include it in a future update."

This gives ease of use and better performance. With some CMSs &amp; frameworks which have their own way of serving assets this however can cause issues so to disable this and include plugin assets in pages manually simply add data-plugins-manual=true to the body tag. This will still trigger the AppStrap init code which starts plugins but it will assume the plugin assets have been loaded into the page manually. All plugins assume .css files go in the head of the page and all .js files go in the footer after jQuery is added but before script.min.js is included (look for the comment line “JS plugins required on all pages” on all pages)."
